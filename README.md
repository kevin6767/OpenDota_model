Creating a dropdown menu that allows the user to pick a hero from a list. 
<br>
Once the hero has been selected, you'll be redirected to the page that shows all of the hero's abilities and stats
<br>
<br>
Step 1. Creating a dropdown that is populated by a fetch to get the api for all the hero's we need. Not sure if we <br>
need to add another fetch for when we make out selection. This will make it easier to code but may not be good practice
<br>
<br>
Step 2. Create routes and links for each of the dropdown menus. Should be pretty straight forward, each route is linked<br>
with a id such as to={$hero.id} or something of the sort so we can dynamically add all of the routes for each hero (111 in all)
<br>
<br>
Step 3. Add in all the data for each hero on a heroDetail page. That will be the template for all of our heroes and make sure 
that all of the data we want to display for them is located on that page. 
<br>
<br>
Step 4. Use Bootstrap to make everything look neat and functional'

Questions
-------------
Is Redux worth using for state management? or is it going to even be needed at all. 
<br>
Do we need to add a master page that displays all the hero's for you to click in instead of using a dropdown?
